The following code provides the building block that is used to study the dynamics in an influenza A infection. A two-cell model (that is mathematically realized through a stochastic system of differential equations) is parametrized via 29 unique parameters that are passed to the program (at execution time) via a user-editable config file. All in all, this program is ment to allow the researcher to study the pharmaceutical treatment schemes commonly used to cure an influenza infection with only very little effort, but at moderate runtimes.

Usage:

1. Create and navigate into a directory `build`.
2. Execute CMake via `cmake ..` and then `make`.
3. Navigate back to the root directory, edit `config.ini` and execute `build/influenza`.
4. Viral titer curves are written into `out.dat`.
